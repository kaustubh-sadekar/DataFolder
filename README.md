# DataFolder
This is a repository which contains some images which can be used for learning OpenCV functionalities. Main purpose of this repository is to provide an easy way to play with images with OpenCV using google colab. It can be easily clones in a colab notebook and the data can be used for performing basic image processing and computervision methods. 

I have used this in [my colab notebooks](https://github.com/kaustubh-sadekar/Colab-Notebooks). There are many simple algorithms of computer vision that I have explained in these notebooks.
**NOTE:** All images in the repository are either captured by myself or are downloded from google. All the downloded images had **Labeled for reuse** permission.
